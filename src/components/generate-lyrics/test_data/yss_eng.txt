There is an original story to this song about 2 people from different situations
There is an original story to this song about 2 people from different situations
nurturing a beautiful friendship in a cruel world, it’s that kind of song. So,
I’ll try to bring that kind of beautiful gentleness to this song
and sing with all my heart.
Let’s start.
Right now, on a quiet night
I drive around aimlessly
To the left, the moon
Shined bright on the side of your face
Just like searching for memories
By putting together words as if to trace them
Hopelessly overflowing
Are memories from our daily lives
From that day I decided to live my life with you
The world slowly began to change
As if I were strong, as if to hide my weaknesses
Those days I spent acting
One day, those gazing eyes suddenly appeared and
Taught me things I never knew
When you have something that needs to be protected
You become all the stronger
In a deep, deep darkness
We met and spent our days together
Days like I’ve never known
Felt so comforting
Or rather, they made me happy
It’s true that I was saved by you
It’s true that I was saved by you
What shined with just the slightest light
Were tears just like a shooting star
Wet drops falling from a clumsy life
Beautiful tears
Gentleness hidden inside that big, strong frame
Your face with traces of pain
I love them all
It’s not about appearances
I finally realized
The cruel echo of a gunshot ripping through the night
Assaulted by a breath signaling the end
The merciless shooting star shined for an instant
And disappeared without answering my prayers
Burned out in this hand is
A golden, gentle comet
Its beautiful mane
I clenched in the darkness
Thank you very much.
