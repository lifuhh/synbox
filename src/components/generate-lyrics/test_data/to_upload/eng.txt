-start-
Before we knew it, the date had changed
Why does the year go by so fast?
Even though I can't grow taller anymore
I woke up to the sound of notifications
I thought it was you, but it wasn't
By some mistake, I hope you start liking me
I feel suffocated in places without you
I can think of silly talks
But I can't find the words to hold you and confess
Ah, yes, that's right
Happy birthday, on top of my unrequited love
-music-
I don't know what love is
But I'm well acquainted with the pain called 'liking'
I want to teach it to you, too
But in the end, it's me who will learn
If today ends and tomorrow comes
No matter how many times, this distance won't shrink
We're just having pointless exchanges
I want to call you by simpler names
Nothing ever gets resolved
With the repetition of boring words
In the continuation of a mismatched story
In the everyday of being alone
Happy birthday, I just want to tell you
I can think of silly talks
But I can't find the words to hold you and confess
Ah, yes, that's right
Happy birthday, my unrequited self
Happy birthday, I just want to tell you
Happy birthday, I just want to tell you
Happy birthday, I just want to tell you
