Goodbye, thank you, I raise my voice
Goodbye, thank you, I raise my voice
Goodbye, thank you, to the limit of my voice
More important than sadness
I want to convey it to your departing back
So that it reaches both warmth and pain
I thought it would continue like this
I was envisioning our tomorrow
The light we called out to is still
Hot in the depths of my chest
We met in the midst of a burning journey
Holding hands and then parting for the future
Every time a dream comes true
I'm waiting for you
Wishing to be strong, I cried
With determination
Now, bound by nostalgic memories
Crying and shouting in this cruel world
As we grow up, it increases
I don't want to lose even one more thing
If I fall into sadness
I won't feel the pain anymore
Your words, your wishes
I swore to protect them
Letting go of my voice, collapsing and falling
A world with only one irreplaceable flaw
A bundle of intense light that I reached out and stopped
For the future that shone and disappeared
Surpassing promises with someone's happiness
Because I move forward without looking back
Because I shout facing only forward
Lighting a flame in my heart, to the far future
Thank you for watching
