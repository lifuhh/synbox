Interlude
Ah, what a truly wonderful world this is
Yet today, I am once again tormented by my own ugliness
Despite that, the feeling of loving someone
Is a feeling that stays with me for a lifetime, causing distress, doesn't it?
Honestly, as for my face
It's as if God drew it with his left hand
None of the love songs in this world
Would make me feel like a loser, would they?
With a mouth that serves no purpose
Wanting to be pitied
Protecting myself with a parasol of sulkiness
I'm just unloved enough
Gleaming, I swallow the night
Top top top top
Look now, love love
What I see before me is a one-milligram firework
Dragondragon, what a funny thing
This world is at peace
Gira gira gira gira
While even that god himself is nowhere to be found
It seems he's already gone insane in a healthy way
Is it the world
Or me?
Symbiosis is just a tangle of flowers, isn't it?
That which is good is what makes sadness
Running, running in a selfless dream
Before this strong approval washes away
Holding onto my phosphorescent skin
Mera Mera
Blowing fire, I am the god of the night
Top top top top
Look there, love love
With a famous tune beside you
Retsu retsu retsu retsu
Unexpectedly funny
Loneliness is Gassorin
Walking through a servile street
With eyes closed
Is that enough, is that enough?
If God were all alone
How happy would he be?
Gleaming, I am the night firework
Top top top top
Look now, love love
What I see before me is a one-milligram firework
Choco dragon
What a funny thing
Soaking in this world
Gibu gibu gibu up gibu up
Flowers are blooming
Feeling shy
I can't stay just as I am
Neither can anyone else
What a truly wonderful world this is
Gira follow me
