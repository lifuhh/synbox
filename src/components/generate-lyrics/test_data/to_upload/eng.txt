No one shines brighter than you
I discovered this feeling for the first time
A new journey begins
The fresh wind after rain
Strong sunlight passing by
From now on, painting the colors of love
Starting with the first page
Two stars that shone brightly
Imagining our future together
A heart full of scars
Healed by your kindness
At some point, a gap appeared
But my heart is filling up
In an unguarded moment
Someday we will talk about dreams
I've always wanted to
Keep looking at your face
I want to see your smile
MERA
Cherishing something precious
The moment to protect
The first step you take
If it's courage
From getting hurt
Running away
Always just taking detours
Lost my way
Pretending to be strong
Deep in my heart
I'm troubled
For the first time I knew
How much you care for me
Words overflow with tears
With slightly different strides
Let's walk step by step
The path for two
A bumpy road
On a blank map
Scattering little decisions
Honestly, let's convey it now
The melody we hear close to our ears
Holding back the overflowing tears
With plain words, I'll tell you
From now on, we'll always be together
This uncontrollable feeling
From the 25 o'clock sky, as it shines
When I realized
A gentle wind blew in my heart
It quietly opens the door to tomorrow
The words now, transcending time, reach eternity
Passing through many seasons
The place where we arrive together
After the setting sun
Let's grow the love we pledged
