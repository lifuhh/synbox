It feels like I'm speaking, it feels like I'm speaking
I can't help but laugh, you won't leave my mind
I feel like I'm going to lose it, but it's okay if I do
I can't say it out loud
Don't be too nice, or I'll fall for you
Don't be too kind, or I'll fall in love with you
If I think of you any more, I won't be able to breathe
In the world where you exist, in this town where you are
Today, I fell in love with you again
By the time this love reaches its final chapter
I believe we'll be holding hands and swearing our love
I want to say I want to see you
But I can't say I want to see you
Because it's you, surely
You won't make me feel uncertain
Being with everyone is surely more fun than just the two of us
That's a new side of you too
But please notice my feelings, don't pretend you don't see them
I love you more than anyone else
Today was really fun
The way home with just the two of us
I really wanted to be with you all the time
I really wanted to be with you all the time
I really wanted to be with you all the time
I really wanted to be with you all the time
I really wanted to be with you all the time
I really wanted to be with you all the time
But this isn't the way home for me
I wanted to be with you
But I never had the courage
I'm sorry, from the beginning
I've always loved you
In the world where you exist
In this town where you are
You were always in love with me too, weren't you?
We will hold hands and swear our love
The end roll of the two of us
Will continue to flow from here on
I wanted to be with you
I really wanted to be with you all the time
But this isn't the way home for me
I wanted to be with you
But this isn't the way home for me
I wanted to be with you
But this isn't the way home for me
I wanted to be with you
But this isn't the way home for me
