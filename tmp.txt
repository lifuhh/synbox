< One dialog design >
1. click => check db for url >> if lyrics exist, auto redirect after X seconds. If not, check db for vid IDs with issues. If exist, display "working on it" or smth, suggest try another url or browse existing vids, display close button.

2. if doesnt exist => validate url >> if fail >> return / report issue button

< Different dialog design >
3. validate url >> if pass >> send transcribe request >> display 

Errors:
- Failed request > Retry
- Gibberish transcription > Retry
- If retry still fail, display prompt for check network / report issue -> submit & close, add vid id to database

>>> Regenerate button / report issue button

4. Transcription successful >> Receive full json of .srt from BE >> Display full lyrics in cross-able lines if choose "Edit", else "Next"

5. show 4 sections of stream (auto navigate) -- romaji > kanji > eng > chi
Users can click through them after they're done, "retry" button enabled when line diff / allow "submit issue" in each tab as well

6. Submit button or smth >> upload to BE >> show a uploading state >> after done allow user to navigate to video (probably same design as first step if data alr in db)
